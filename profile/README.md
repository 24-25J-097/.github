### link: https://github.com/24-25J-097

## Overview
Welcome to the **Automated Medical Conditions Detection in E.N.T Images Using Deep Learning Techniques** GitHub organization. This organization hosts all code repositories related to our research on the automated identification of ENT-related conditions using advanced machine learning techniques. Our objective is to develop, test, and deploy web and mobile applications for identifying sinusitis, foreign objects in the throat, cholesteatoma in the ear, and pharyngitis in oral images.

## Repositories

### 1. **ForeignObject-Identification**
   - System to identify foreign objects in lateral neck X-rays, utilizing deep learning for automated detection and analysis within minutes. It generates a detailed report, focusing exclusively on lateral neck X-rays to maintain the research gap.

### 2. **Sinusitis-Detection**
   - Web and mobile app for sinusitis detection from Waters' view X-rays using deep learning. Designed for clinical environments to provide quick, reliable diagnostic support.

### 3. **Cholesteatoma-Detection**
   - Software solution for identifying cholesteatoma by analyzing eardrum images through deep learning algorithms. Supports clinicians in identifying cholesteatoma using high-resolution ear drum imaging.

### 4. **Pharyngitis-Detection**
   - Application to detect pharyngitis and its severity levels using oral images. Also identifies disease subtypes and includes a user-friendly interface for medical staff and clinical environments.

### 5. **ML-Models**
   - Repository for the deep learning models used in all submodules, including architectures such as CNN, ResNet50, VGG, DenseNet, and ensemble techniques.

### 6. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation on the research, including setup instructions, API references, model descriptions, and project management notes.

## Project Goals

1. **Quick, Accurate Diagnoses**: Provide automated, high-accuracy solutions for detecting sinusitis, foreign throat objects, cholesteatoma, and pharyngitis.
2. **Severity Classification**: Implement models to classify severity stages of sinusitis and pharyngitis.
3. **User-Friendly Access**: Design web and mobile applications that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows.

## Getting Started

Each repository contains a detailed `README.md` with setup instructions, requirements, and usage notes. Please refer to individual repositories for more information on deployment and testing.
